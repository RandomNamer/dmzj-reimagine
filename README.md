# The once No.1 site for web crawler and mobile dev learners, now in another flavor

Fine, I will do it myself. Yet another set of scripts for archiving light novels and comics (both online and hidden) from [dmzj.com](dmzj.com), a popular Chinese translated manga site. There are great [3rd party apps](https://github.com/xiaoyaocz/flutter_dmzj) for dmzj and they are much more useful to most people. I write these just for researching purposes. The API keys are not released, you may find it by decompiling the app yourself.

# DMZJ won't live long.

Working as for Oct 2024. I'm planning a [final update](https://zeyuzhang3.notion.site/DMZJ-crawler-final-PRD-and-tracker-132d6dc1a5c280fb8f86e0081c7ed5b4) to embrace the demise of the once legendary pirate.

## Archive light novels as EPUB files
see [here](./epubMaker.js)

## Archive and organize manga as images and metadata-included `cbz` files
- see [here](./comicArchiver.js)
- Supports updating comic archives using incremental option.
