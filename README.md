# dmzj-reimagine
Fine, I will do it myself. These are scripts for archiving light novels and comics (both online and hidden) from [dmzj.com](dmzj.com), a popular Chinese translated manga site. There are great [3rd party apps](https://github.com/xiaoyaocz/flutter_dmzj) for dmzj and it's much more useful to most people. I write these just for researching purposes. The API keys are not released, you may find it by decompiling the app yourself.

Working as for April 2024.

## Archive light novels as EPUB files
see [here](./epubMaker.js)

## Archive and organize manga as images and metadata-included `cbz` files
- see [here](./comicArchiver.js)
- Supports updating comic archives using incremental option.
